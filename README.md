# OpenAI #python 
This repository contains a collection of mini projects built with Python and OpenAI. Each project showcases a unique use case, ranging from OCR-based data extraction and document search to Excel analytics, Jira test case automation, log analysis, and Tableau chat assistance. The goal is to experiment with AI-powered solutions that reduce manual effort, enhance data insights, and streamline workflows in QA, shipping, logistics, and analytics domains.

# Tableau Chat Assistance
Tableau Chat Assistance â€“ Interact with multiple Tableau dashboards via a chat interface to fetch filtered data, insights, and AI-generated graphs.

# Jira Test Case Generator
